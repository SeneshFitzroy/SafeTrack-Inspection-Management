## **Project Overview 🌍**

**SafeTrack** revolutionizes Public Health Inspections by eliminating the need for physical paperwork, making inspections faster, more accurate, and more efficient. This web-based platform allows Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) in Sri Lanka to conduct digital inspections, store records securely, track violations, and generate reports instantly, all from a user-friendly dashboard.

---

## **Problem Statement 😕**

The traditional paper-based system for inspections is:

- **Time-Consuming ⏳**: PHIs spend most of their time on paperwork, reducing the time for actual inspections.
- **Inefficient ⚙️**: Accessing past records is slow, and data entry often leads to errors.
- **Cumbersome 📚**: PHIs carry large stacks of paper and forms, which are prone to loss or damage.
- **Limited Reporting 📊**: Lack of real-time reporting and analytics slows down decision-making.
- **Delayed Actions ⏰**: Complaints and violations are often lost in paperwork, delaying enforcement.

---

## **Proposed Solution 💡**

**SafeTrack** digitizes the entire inspection process, offering:

- **Instant Data Entry 📥**: PHIs can directly input inspection data into the platform, eliminating paper forms.
- **Real-Time Tracking ⏱️**: Automated scheduling, tracking, and follow-ups ensure inspections are never missed.
- **Digital Records 💾**: All inspection data is stored securely, accessible instantly.
- **Automated Reporting 📝**: Reports are generated in real-time, providing valuable insights into trends and compliance.
- **Efficient Complaint Handling 📞**: Public complaints are recorded and tracked through the platform for quick resolution.

---

## **Key Features 🌟**

- **User-Friendly Web Interface 🖥️**: Easy-to-navigate dashboard designed for quick data entry during inspections.
- **Shop Management 🏢**: A centralized database containing details of food establishments, inspection history, and compliance status.
- **Digital Inspection Forms 📝**: Paper-based forms like HC 800, Sandeeshaya Form, and others are digitized for automated validation.
- **Task Scheduling 📅**: Schedule inspections, track follow-ups, and ensure compliance.
- **Analytics and Reporting 📊**: Real-time trends and reports to help decision-makers identify high-risk establishments.
- **User Profile & Management 👤**: Allows PHIs to manage their profiles and view inspection history.
